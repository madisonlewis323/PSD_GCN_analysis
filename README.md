Psychosis Spectrum Disorder Classification with Graph Convolutional Networks
Please see our preprint for more details: https://www.researchgate.net/publication/378179595_Improved_classification_accuracy_of_psychosis_spectrum_disorders_using_graph_convolutional_networks_using_structurally_constrained_functional_connectomes

Our model is based on the work of Lei et al. in "Graph convolutional networks reveal network-level functional dysconnectivity in schizophrenia". Please see the paper for the description of data analysis. Their code is publicly available here https://github.com/alien18/GCN_SCZ_Classification.
