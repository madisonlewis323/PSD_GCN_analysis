Psychosis Spectrum Disorder Classification with Graph Convolutional Networks


Our model is based on the work of Lei et al. in "Graph convolutional networks reveal network-level functional dysconnectivity in schizophrenia". Please see the paper for the description of data analysis. Their code is publicly available here https://github.com/alien18/GCN_SCZ_Classification. 

Code that we modified for our specific analysis and in order to load our network files is provided.
